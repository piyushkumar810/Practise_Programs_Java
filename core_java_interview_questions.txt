--------------------------------------------------core java questions--------------------------------------------------

q1) why java is not 100% object-oriented?
ans -> because of primitive data types namely:-
       boolean, byte, char, int, float, long, double, short.

       to make them object-oriented we have wrapper class which actually wrap the primitive data type to object type.

q2) why pointers are not allowed in java.
ans ->a) they are unsafe.
      b) since jvm is responsible for allocating and deallocating the memory , thus in order to avoid direct access
         to the memory by the user, pointer are discouraged in java.

q3) what is jit compiler in java ?
ans ->

q4) why is string immutable in java ?
ans -> a) String pool requires string to be immutable otherwise shared reference can be changed form anywhere.
       b) Security because string is shared in different area like file system, database connection, networking connection
          , having immutable string allows you to be secure and safe because no one can change reference of string once
           it is created.

q5) what is marker interface ?
ans -> a marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member function.
       in simpler term, an empty interface is called the marker interface
       eg:- Serializable, Cloneable
       public interface Cloneable{}

q6) Can you override a private or static method in java ?
ans -> a) you cannot override private or static member in java.
       b) you cannot override a private method in sub-class because it's not accessible there, what you do is create another
          private method with the same name in the child class.
       c) for static method if you create a similar method with same return type and same method argument in child class then
          it will hide the super class method , this is known as method hiding.

q7) does "finally" always execute in java ?
ans -> not in following cases.
        i) "System.exit()" function
        ii) system crash

q8) what method does the object class have ?
ans ->

q9) how can you make your class immutable ?
ans -> check on youtube

q10) what is singleton class in java and how can we make a class singleton.
ans -> Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any give time, in one jvm
       eg:-
         public class animal {
          private static animal single_instance = null;
          private animal()
          {}
          public static animal.getInstance()
          {
            if(single_instance == null)
                single_instance = new animal();

            return single_instance;
          }
         }
